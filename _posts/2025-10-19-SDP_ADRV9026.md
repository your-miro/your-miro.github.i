## Overview (TL;DR)

This post introduces the fundamental concepts behind RF power amplifier
design and digital predistortion (DPD), with a focus on practical
implementation and real-world system benchmarkingâ€¦

## Utilizing the Transceiver Evaluation Software (TES)
### Full GUI Operation
##### Step 1: Connecting to the board
After booting the FPGA board (ADS9-V2EBZ) and turning on the RF board (ADRV9026) the GUI, and by extension all the .NET assemblies provided by ADI, will be allowed to remotely SSH into the linux system present onto the FPGA board through its embedded subroutines \(more on this later \[link should be provided\]\). This connection is established for two different purposes. The device on which the GUI is opened will be used to load configuration settings and send them directly to the board. Once that is done, the user may navigate to the Transmit/Receive sections for utilizing their respective functionalities.

For our intended purposes we will select the "98_LinkSharing" Preset profile as it fits our use case, for testing. Should you use the setup in conjunction with the signal analyzer in the ART lab, a lower sampling rate like the standard 153.6/122.8 MHz. This is to esnure compatibility as the highest rate the latter can attain is 200 MHz.

Make sure Gain Tables are configured correctly for RX. Gain indices are a preset to the operation of the board once the voltage thresholds of the receiver ports are crossed. More details can be found in the <a href="https://www.analog.com/media/radioverse-adrv9026/adrv9026-system-development-user-guide-ug-1727.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ADRV9026/ADRV9029 System Development User Guide</a>.

Reference clock field must be checked and confirmed to be 122.88 MHz to ensure proper operation of the evaluation setup.

Once your desired initialization settings are selected, simply press program in the top ribbon to initialize the board with the profile settings.

##### Step 2: Tx & Rx
The following figures provide a step-by-step guide to be able to transmit tones/waveforms and consequently receive them: 
> Preceding the transmission of any arbitrary waveform besides a Continuous-wave tone is the actual creation of the waveform to be loaded. More details on creating a 5G signal can be found [here](#matlab-files).

### Semi-GUI Operation (Ironpython)
For this section, the Ironpython tab will be our first-hand method serial communication between the setup and the computer. The scripts is to be used to load the configuration settings skipping the majority of Step 1. The proceeding steps will be assumed as was done in the previous section.

### Fully scripted Operation (Only Python for now)
In this way of operating the system, the user will assume full control of communication from the auto-generated Ironpython code + other code to utilize the other functionalities of the system. Configuration will follow as in the previous section, whereas, the desired use-case of the user will be communicated through the CLI \(or by extension a new GUI utilizing the same subroutines a little more efficiently\).
